Create a workflow for building a modular greeting card generator system.

The system should have 3 themed card templates:
- Birthday cards
- Holiday cards (generic, inclusive of all celebrations)
- Congratulations cards (graduations, promotions, achievements)

Each card template needs:
1. A design specification (color palette, tone guidelines, key phrases)
2. A markdown template with placeholders
3. Quality review to ensure consistency

Structure the workflow in 3 phases:
- Phase 1: Design Specification (3 parallel agents - one per theme)
- Phase 2: Template Implementation (3 parallel agents - one per theme)
- Phase 3: Quality Review (1 agent reviewing all templates)

Output files should go in greeting-cards/ with subfolders:
- greeting-cards/specs/ for design specifications
- greeting-cards/templates/ for card templates
- greeting-cards/review/ for final quality report

## Workflow Design Validation

### Architecture ✅
- [x] Total phases: 5
- [x] Profile: complex
- [x] Parallel phases: 3 and 5
- [x] Sequential phases: 1, 2, 4
- [x] Human checkpoint: Phase 5

### Agent Assignments ✅
- [x] Phase 1: 1 agent (feature-analyzer)
- [x] Phase 2: 1 agent (config-implementer)
- [x] Phase 3: 2 agents parallel (mcp-migrator, ui-migrator)
- [x] Phase 4: 1 agent (cli-implementer)
- [x] Phase 5: 2 agents parallel (docs-implementer, test-implementer)
- [x] Total unique agents: 6

### MCP Integration ✅
- [x] Orchestrator uses start_phase, complete_phase
- [x] Subagents use start_task, complete_task
- [x] get_context for monitoring
- [x] log_milestone for progress
- [x] log_decision for architecture choices
- [x] log_issue for blockers
- [x] complete_workflow at end

### Context Management ✅
- [x] /compact after each phase
- [x] get_context before resuming
- [x] Recovery pattern documented
- [x] State restoration via MCP

### Scope Coverage ✅
- [x] packages/config/ (new)
- [x] packages/cli/ (new)
- [x] packages/mcp-server/ (migration)
- [x] packages/web-ui/ (migration)
- [x] Documentation updates
- [x] Tests (unit + integration)

## Compliance with Standards

### Workflow System Standards ✅
- [x] No memory.md file (MCP state only)
- [x] Direct pattern (subagents call MCP directly)
- [x] Workflow_id passed to subagents
- [x] Phase_id used for task grouping
- [x] Git snapshots via complete_task
- [x] Subagent_type: general-purpose for file-writing

### Mission Control Standards ✅
- [x] TypeScript strict mode mentioned
- [x] Zod validation required
- [x] Prisma enums only
- [x] No cross-package imports
- [x] Conventional commits
- [x] Git snapshots for accountability

## Pending Actions

### Before Execution
- [ ] Call start_workflow MCP tool → get workflow_id
- [ ] Replace {PENDING_MCP_CALL} with actual workflow_id
- [ ] Create safety branch: git checkout -b npm-distribution-workflow
- [ ] Verify all tests pass: pnpm test
- [ ] Verify MCP server connected: /mcp

### During Execution
- [ ] Monitor via get_context after each phase
- [ ] Use /compact to manage context
- [ ] Handle blockers requiring human review
- [ ] Verify builds after each phase

### After Execution
- [ ] Human review at Phase 5 checkpoint
- [ ] Approve or request changes
- [ ] Call complete_workflow
- [ ] Merge safety branch

## Validation Result

**Status**: ✅ WORKFLOW READY FOR INITIALIZATION

All required files created with comprehensive content.
Workflow structure validated against standards.
MCP integration properly designed.
Context management strategy in place.

**Next Action**: Obtain workflow_id via start_workflow MCP call.
